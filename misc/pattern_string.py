"""
You are given a pattern, such as [a b a b]. You are also given a string, example "redblueredblue". I need to write a program that tells whether the string follows the given pattern or not.

A few examples:

Pattern: [a b b a] String: catdogdogcat returns 1

Pattern: [a b a b] String: redblueredblue returns 1

Pattern: [a b b a] String: redblueredblue returns 0
